# YalaKora Web Scraping (Daily)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a daily web scraper for **YalaKora**, a sports site, extracting match data and storing it in structured formats (CSV, Excel, etc.). The scraper runs periodically (by day) to collect up-to-date information. It’s built using Python (e.g. requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas) and is meant to serve as both a learning tool and a foundation for more advanced scraping or analytics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x  
- pip  
- Internet access (for scraping)  

### Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mostafasayed118/yalakora-webScarping-by-day.git
   cd yalakora-webScarping-by-day
(Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:
  python -m venv venv
  # On Windows
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  # On macOS / Linux
  source venv/bin/activate
Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage Instructions

Run the scraper script (e.g. scraper.py or notebook) to fetch new daily match data
  python scraper.py

The script fetches data from YalaKora, parses the relevant HTML elements (match info, scores, etc.), and outputs a CSV (or Excel) file into the data/ folder with a name like matches_YYYYMMDD.csv.

⚠️ Best Practices & Considerations

Use a User-Agent header in your requests (include contact info or repo link) to be polite.

Obey the site’s robots.txt and respect scraping rules.

Introduce delays (e.g. time.sleep()) between requests to avoid overloading the server.

Implement error-handling (HTTP errors, missing elements) and possibly retry logic.

Consider using APIs (if YalaKora has any) for more reliable data access.

📄 Sample Data Fields (CSV)
date	match_id	team_home	team_away	score_home	score_away	league / competition	…
2025-09-25	1234	Al Ahly	Zamalek	2	1	Premier League	…
🔮 Future Enhancements

Convert notebook code into a modular Python script (with functions / classes).

Schedule automatic runs with GitHub Actions or cron jobs.

Add logging and monitoring (e.g. retries, alerts).

Store data in a database (SQLite, Postgres) for easier queries / analysis.

Build simple analytics or dashboard (e.g. trends, top teams, etc.).

Add a license file (e.g. LICENSE) — MIT is a common choice for open-source projects.
